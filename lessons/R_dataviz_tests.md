## Test yourself SOLUTIONS 
1. Download and load the file ".Rdata"R_dataviz into your environment.

2. Plot three plots from the dataset "X" to answer the next set of questions. There are multiple columns in the dataset, so feel free to explore and play around first.
    a. What are the average weights per sex? Show as a histogram.
    b. What are the range of scute numbers per set? Show as a boxplot.
    c. What are the correlations between the biometrics? Show as a correlation plot. 

3. Now, using the dataset "Y", plot a heatmap. Aim for clarity! 

4. And finally, look at dataset "Z". Plot it the best way you think would show its key feature. 

5. "Knit" your R markdown file into an html page or a pdf.
