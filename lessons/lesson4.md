# Lesson 4: Another potentially fun example.
Let's reproduce this paper.



## Test yourself! 
1. Create an R markdown file (using RStudio). Save the file as "yourname_Lesson4.Rmd". Once again, delete the instructions starting from "This is an [R...". For the remaining exercises, insert the code as R chunks when you are satisified with your solutions. An R chunk is code placed  after a line that starts with ` ```{ r } `and ends before a line with ` ``` `.  
2. Load the file "lesson4.Rdata" into your environment.

"Knit" your R markdown file into an html page, a pdf and a word document. Save the latter two. Email either file to me! 
 
Solutions: Next week!
